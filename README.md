The Villanova Ride Share Project for Platform Based Computing Final Project
Team Mate: Madison Day
* The Villanova Ride Share Project is designed to make commuting easier and more efficient for the Villanova community.
* This application is created with user needs in mind, which are the Villanova University students, along with environmental considerations.
* The aim of this project is to make commuting easier for both the Villanova students who do not own a car and spend excessive money on ride-apps, and for the students who own a car and would enjoy the company of another Villanovan whilst sharing the cost of gas of the trip.
* Users can sign up to share rides, offering or seeking transportation within the vicinity of Villanova. Thus, unnecessary ride-app trips will not happen, and the total amount of cars that travel to similar locations would significantly decrease, decreasing or carbon footprint as students of Villanova as well. 
* Users can add a ride by specifying details such as date, time, and destination, or browse existing rides and join one that works with their schedule.
* For added convenience, users can also add their cars to the database, providing details like make, model, and mileage, which helps in organizing and managing rides.
* Safety, reliability, and community spirit are the driving values of this project, aiming to foster a culture of shared commuting and environmental responsibility among Villanova students.
